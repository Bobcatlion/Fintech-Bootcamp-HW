# Fintech Case Study

## Overview and Origin:

* Ripple
* Founded in 2012
* Founded by Chris Larson and Jed McCaleb
* Ryan Fugger conceived Ripple in 2004 after working on a local exchange trading system in Vancouver. The intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively empower individuals and communities to create their own money.  After discussions with McCaleb and long-standing members of the Ripple community, Fugger handed over the reins. In September 2012, Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb co-founded the corporation OpenCoin. On September 26, 2013, OpenCoin officially changed its name to Ripple Labs, Inc.
* Andreessen Horowitz, FF Angel LLC, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Pantera Capital, Vast Ventures, Bitcoin Opportunity Fund donated 2.5million in 2013

## Business Activities:

* Ripple operates on an open-source and peer-to-peer decentralized platform that allows for a seamless transfer of money in any form, whether it's dollars, Yen, euros, or cryptocurrencies, like litecoin or bitcoin. Ripple is a global payments network and counts major banks and financial services amongst its customers. XRP is used in its products to facilitate quick conversion between different currencies
* The Ripple network does not run with a proof-of-work (PoW) system like bitcoin or a proof-of-stake (PoS) system like Nxt. Instead, transactions rely on a consensus protocol in order to validate account balances and transactions on the system. The consensus works to improve the integrity of the system by preventing double-spending.
* Ripple improves on some of the drawbacks attributed to traditional banks. Transactions are settled within seconds on the Ripple network (even though the platform handles millions of transactions frequently). This is unlike banks which could take days or weeks to complete a wire transfer. The fee to conduct transactions on Ripple is also minimal, with the minimum transaction cost required for a standard transaction set at 0.00001 XRP, compared to the large fees charged by banks for conducting cross-border payments.

## Landscape:

* Ripple is in the banking industry
* X-Rapid, X-Via, ODL(On-Demand Liquidity)
* SWIFT, Stellar Lumens, Stablecoins, Digital Fiat

## Results:

* Through a number of solutions, Ripple aims to provide an efficient system for the direct transfer of money that settles in real-time, while being cheaper, more secure and more transparent than other transfer systems employed by traditional financial institutions. As of 2021, Ripple offers a global payments platform for some 2 million users worldwide for the XRP token and its fully decentralized ledger
* Ripple has been wildly successful in the global front working with banks and improving the handling of cross border remittance
* Since its inception in 2012 successful with improving cross border remittances. In comparision with their competitors such Western Union and Moneygram; Ripple brings to clients an instant settlement solution by leveraging XRP. In 2019 Ripple partnered with Moneygram.

## Recommendations:

* If i were an advisor for Ripple, I would suggest Ripple make a larger social presence in the United States. Their lack of exposure does make sense given the current SEC lawsuit in the US however, planting seeds of growth during this lawsuit will surely help expediate mainstream adoption once this case is settled. Ripple is an industry leader and has worked closely with the SEC and US lobbyist for their tenure; they understand the lay of the land. Unlike other crypto companies, Ripple doesn't advertise to mainstream media an focuses solely on exposure to market manipulators and banks. Seeing the wild success of companies such as crypto.com and their UFC deal, i would like to see Ripple do something similiar perhaps partnering up with a Venmo or Zelle.
